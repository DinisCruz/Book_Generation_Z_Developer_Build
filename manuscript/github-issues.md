## GitHub Issues

All content related to this book is hosted at the GitHub [DinisCruz/Book_Generation_Z_Developer](https://github.com/DinisCruz/Book_Generation_Z_Developer) repo.

This repo not only contains all text (in Markdown), but also all pending [issues and ideas](https://github.com/DinisCruz/Book_Generation_Z_Developer/issues). I&#39;m using the exact workflow and ideas presented in this book in the development of this book :)

You can read more about GitHub and Git in the respective chapters, but if you want to be involved in an open source and Creative Commons project, this would be a good place to start.
