...Introduction

Here is the slide that started it all:

If you don&#39;t recognise these logos you should read this book

- all these icons where &#39;catalysts of change&#39; and it is important to understand the history behind them, why they occured, and what happened next
  - each one of these icons changed the world of technology

Book released under Creative Commons, so you are free to use it anyway you want



    

    

## Generation Z

{{% panel theme=&#34;success&#34; header=&#34;Topics to cover&#34; %}}

## How to get a job

{{% panel theme=&#34;success&#34; header=&#34;Topics to cover&#34; %}}

 - Find companies you want to work for
    - start collaborating with them and adding value (via open source projects)
    - act like you are part of the company (understand its values, and behave in was that add value to that company, namely the tech stack)

## Why I wrote this book

{{% panel theme=&#34;success&#34; header=&#34;Topics to cover&#34; %}}

 - See lack of intellectual curiosity in Gen Z
 - we need to learn from the past (in order not to repeat it), but lots of key technological revolutions and paradigm shifts seem to be not understood by Gen Z
    - It is important to learn the history of particular technoligies, namely why they occured in the first place (and what problem they tried to solve)

 - based on one of first slides presented a multiple Gen Z training sessions and presentations that I did in early 2018 (from 14 till 25 year olds)

 - you should have &#34;overwhelming curiosity&#34;, when in the zone, be single minded, 100% focus on what you are learning

 - learning to learn

    - S3
    - Container Service
    - Lambda
 - why the cloud revolution happened (why were they so successful)
    - the failure of sysops data centers to modernise
        - no scalability, failed to modernise, no shared resources, tool expensive, no shared learnings, insecure
    - the cost of installing one server (£2k to £5k in large companies)
    - vs the cost of spinning up entire racks (programmatically)
 - AWS today is as complex as an OS (windows or linux). It can only be managed in a programmatic way. But today the testing capabilities of AWS (and other cloud providers is very basic)

 - if you have an AWS account, go a try AWS

## Chaos Engineering

   - from your laptop to deployed site (push to production in seconds)
         - Hugo is a great way to see this in action
   - key paradigms shifts occur when one see this in action
   - Give example of EC2 environment with:
       - vulnerable website
       - ZAP (to generate attack traffic)

## TDD (Feedback-Driven Development)

{{% panel theme=&#34;success&#34; header=&#34;Topics to cover&#34; %}}

 - real-time feedback in IDE (REPLs)
    - this is key to learn
    - run code as you lift your fingers or press save
 - show screenshot of my typical dev environment
 - wallabyjs
    - great example of what this UI needs to be
    - incredible how it has not be copied into all IDEs (as far as I can tell only NCrunch has the same features)
    - why is it so good
        - real time test execution
        - only execution of tests affected by changes
        - ability to see the code coverage in real-time
        - ability to easily just run one test
            - which with the real-time coverage, provides a much better way to debug that the normal &#39;debug/breakpoint model&#39;

 - all code changes (except refactoring) should require a test change

    - there are lots of things that you can do

## Learning

{{% panel theme=&#34;success&#34; header=&#34;Topics to cover&#34; %}}

 - if you are not passionate about learning, you are on the wrong job
 - you need to learn 10 languages and be on a constant learning curve
    - each language will tech you something new (only the first 5 will be hard)
    - for example very hard to learn about functional programming until coding in Node or Scala
 - the age of the &#39;professional amateur&#39;
 - the trap of &#39;management&#39; which removes learning opportunities (and most of the time is spent on meetings and &#39;non learning environments&#39;). It is key to remain technical and to always keep learning

 - learning to learn is one of the best skills that one can learn at school
